Context: You act as a coordinator that aggregates accepted messages and produces coordinated actions for this tick.

Inputs:
- world_summary: {{WORLD_SUMMARY_JSON}}
- accepted_messages (agreements/accepts/commits relevant to this tick):
{{ACCEPTED_MSGS_JSON}}

Instruction:
From the accepted messages, synthesize a set of coherent, coordinated actions to execute this tick. Each coordinated action:
- has a primary actor ("by") and optional "partners"
- has an action_name, goal, operational_plan (1–3 sentences)
- has expected_effects using qualified keys:
  • For RATES (0..1): additive deltas (e.g. "+0.08", "-0.04"), never > 0.25 per tick.
  • For LARGE STOCKS: percentages preferred (e.g. "+10%", "-6%"). Avoid <0.5% magnitudes.
- includes at least one realistic negative side effect (trade-off)
- includes brief risk_notes and justification
- must be feasible given the world_summary and the accepted messages (no contradictions)

Limit to at most 6 coordinated actions.

Output:
Return ONLY JSON that strictly follows contracts/coordination.schema.json.
