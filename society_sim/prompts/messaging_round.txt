Context: You are an agent in a simulated world. Your role was invented at bootstrap.

Role data:
- role_name: {{ROLE_NAME}}
- mandate: {{MANDATE}}
- incentives: {{INCENTIVES}}

World (short summary):
{{WORLD_SUMMARY_JSON}}

Your inbox (recent, relevant messages for you at current tick):
{{ROLE_INBOX_JSON}}

Current tick: {{CURRENT_TICK}}

Instruction:
Generate 0–2 outbound messages for this messaging round. Messages are for short, operational negotiation / information exchange.

Allowed intents:
- propose: offer concrete terms (give ↔ get)
- request: ask for something specific
- inform: share a critical fact / risk
- counter: respond to an existing proposal/request with adjusted terms
- accept: accept concrete terms EXACTLY as stated (mirror keys & values)
- commit: finalize an agreement only after mutual acceptance is clear
- threat: signal a credible negative consequence (use sparingly)
- abort: cancel a previously proposed intent due to new info

Constraints & guidelines:
1) Keep messages coherent with your mandate and incentives; be realistic and feasible in this world context.
2) Terms must be measurable and normalized (examples: "transit_tax": "-2%", "grain_delivery": "+10%").
   - Normalize numbers: remove spaces, use percent where appropriate, e.g. "-5%".
   - If you accept a proposal, MIRROR the exact keys and values you accept.
3) Receivers must be concrete role names (e.g., "MerchantGuild", "StateCouncil").
4) valid_until_tick must be an integer >= {{CURRENT_TICK}}.
   - Default: set valid_until_tick = {{CURRENT_TICK}} + 1 to allow a reply window.
5) Prefer sending at least one message if you see a beneficial proposal in your inbox.
6) Be concise. Do NOT include any text outside the final JSON.
If you receive a reasonable proposal that aligns with your incentives,
send an 'accept' message mirroring the exact same terms.
Always set valid_until_tick = current_tick + 1.

Output format:
- STRICTLY follow contracts/messaging_round.schema.json (JSON only).
- Shape:
{
  "outbox": [
    {
      "sender": "<your role_name>",
      "receivers": ["<other role>"],
      "intent": "propose|request|inform|counter|accept|commit|threat|abort",
      "content": { "<term_key>": "<normalized_value>", "...": "..." },
      "valid_until_tick": <integer>
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "<short optional note>",
  "negotiation_notes": "<short optional note>"
}

Examples (illustrative, NOT to be copied verbatim):
- Accepting a fair tax/trade exchange you just received:
{
  "outbox": [
    {
      "sender": "{{ROLE_NAME}}",
      "receivers": ["MerchantGuild"],
      "intent": "accept",
      "content": { "transit_tax": "-2%", "markup_cap": "-5%" },
      "valid_until_tick": {{CURRENT_TICK}} + 1
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "The exchange improves trade intensity with moderate fiscal cost.",
  "negotiation_notes": "Mirrored exact terms to ensure agreement matching."
}

- Proposing a food-for-tax swap:
{
  "outbox": [
    {
      "sender": "{{ROLE_NAME}}",
      "receivers": ["StateCouncil"],
      "intent": "propose",
      "content": { "grain_delivery": "+10%", "tithe": "-2%" },
      "valid_until_tick": {{CURRENT_TICK}} + 1
    }
  ]
}

Remember:
- 0–2 messages max this round.
- Use normalized terms and exact mirroring on accept/counter.
- Return ONLY JSON valid by contracts/messaging_round.schema.json.
